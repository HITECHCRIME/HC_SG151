## Lyrics

```

not alone


wanna say it all
i don't know
what the fuck you want with me
i'm not a fucking animal

hey so

what don't you find some leverage
sewing stitches from all the heartbreak

all the sights are behind a veil

gonna say it now
hindsight
saying no
saying no



let me go now
let me go now
let me really go now



let it all out
let it all out
right or wrong

i don't really fucking know man
this seems like 
aye

```
